## Current Position

- **Milestone:** `5.0` Multi-hit Moves & Chip Damage Integration - **COMPLETE**
- **HEAD:** `fa8501d`
- **Tag:** `v0.11.0`
- **Tests:** 602 passing, 0 failures, 0 xfail
- **Performance:** N=4 multi-hit + chip hard ceiling met; worst measured 17.886 ms

---
## Phase 4: COMPLETE

- **Completed:** 2026-05-07
- **Tag:** `v0.10.0`
- **Merge commit:** `2f342d8`
- **Tests:** 518 → 560 (+42), 0 failures, 0 xfail
- **Performance:** N=4 convolution avg 0.215 ms (budget 100 ms)
- **Scope:** Fraction-based 1-4 turn KO probability composer, 16-roll Q12 distribution, crit-rate integration, and canonical modifier scenarios.
- **Next:** Phase 5 preview — multi-hit plus chip damage composition.

---

## Phase 5: COMPLETE

- **Completed:** 2026-05-07
- **Tag:** `v0.11.0`
- **Merge commit:** `fa8501d`
- **Tests:** 560 -> 602 (+42), 0 failures, 0 xfail
- **Scope:** Multi-hit move probability distributions plus deterministic residual chip integration.
- **Multi-hit:** Tier A 2-5 distribution, Skill Link, Loaded Dice, and Population Bomb Tier C support.
- **Chip:** Burn, poison, toxic, Leech Seed, Curse, sand/hail/snow, and binding residuals.
- **Precision:** `Fraction` probability mass throughout; Q12 damage rolls remain integer-only.
- **Performance:** N=4 multi-hit + chip worst measured 17.886 ms with crit-mixed Bullet Seed; Population Bomb + Loaded Dice measured 3.500 ms. Both remain under the 100 ms hard ceiling.

### Phase 5.1: Performance Optimization Accepted

- **Branch:** `feat/phase-5.1-bullet-seed-perf`
- **Diagnosis:** H2/H4 - missing survivor bucket merge plus convolution loop overhead.
- **Fix:** Composer survivor state uses dense integer buckets below KO threshold; `Fraction` construction is deferred to the final by-turn probability boundary.
- **Tests:** 602 default -> 604 with slow (+2), 0 failures, 0 xfail.

| Case | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| bullet_seed_default_burn_no_crit | 13.608 ms | 6.137 ms |
| bullet_seed_default_burn_with_crit | 17.886 ms | 8.861 ms |
| bullet_seed_loaded_dice_toxic_with_crit | 2.207 ms | 1.161 ms |
| population_bomb_loaded_dice_poison_with_crit | 3.500 ms | 2.388 ms |

#### Perf Test Strategy

Perf regression tests use the `slow` pytest marker and are excluded from the default test run. This isolation prevents resource contention with 600+ functional tests that otherwise inflate measurements 2.1~2.6x in shared-environment runs.

**Usage:**
- Default development: `pytest` (602 tests, perf tests excluded)
- Perf verification: `pytest -m slow` (2 perf tests, clean env)
- Full coverage: `pytest -m ""` (604 tests, perf may be flaky)

**Threshold:** 15ms median (warmup + 3-run) on the bullet_seed worst case. T3 standalone baseline 8.861ms; threshold provides ~70% headroom for per-machine variance while still catching algorithmic regressions.

**Phase 6 note:** New perf tests (Parental Bond, Accuracy-Turn) should inherit the `slow` marker via module-level `pytestmark`.

Soft target 5ms partially recovered. The with_crit case at 8.86ms is accepted; hard ceiling 100ms maintained with >90% headroom. Deferred deeper optimization (FFT-style convolution) is out of scope until Phase 6 baseline is established.

T1 to record local measurement post-merge for cross-validation.

### Phase 6 Outlook

- Parental Bond interaction modeling.
- Accuracy and turn-engine interactions for move continuation and chip timing.
- Broader battle-state integration on top of the Phase 4/5 probability core.

## Test Count Trajectory

```
292 → 296 → 304 → 316 → 326 → 341 → 357 → 375 → 393 → 381 → 386 → 393
 (init)  PR#1  PR#2  PR#3  PR#4  PR#5  PR#6  PR#7  PR#8  squash  Δ-a   Δ-d
```

Parity tests: `112 → 114 → 118 → 122 → 128 → 134 → 140 → 148 → 139`

The dip from 393 → 381 reflects the squash + silent-deletion restoration of 4 item tests, not a regression.

### `3.1.5a-d` Consolidated Squash → `e8a0893`
Sequential PRs #6–9 + PR #9.1 hotfix were developed in working directory and squashed into one commit. Splitting into 4 reconstructed commits provided no real bisect value (intermediate states were never tested in isolation).

Restored 4 item tests silently deleted during PR #9:
- charcoal, eviolite, light_ball, species_orb (adamant / lustrous / griseous orb)

### `3.1.5a-Δ` (Sheer Force suppression) → `587d29f`
- Path B chosen: no secondary-effect resolver exists yet
- Added pure predicate in `advisor/damage/move_categories.py`
- Tests: 381 → 386
- Note: commit subject reads `3.1.6a / PR #8a` (pre-rename); milestone code is `3.1.5a-Δ`

### `3.1.5d-Δ` (Life Orb recoil) → `d3469ca`

## Next Decision Point

`3.1` is closed. Choose next branch before opening any new patch:

- **Option A — `3.2` Item Wiring**: horizontal expansion, fastest path to single-hit Smogon parity 100%
- **Option B — `4.1` Turn Engine**: vertical expansion, unlocks deferred items naturally
- **Option C — `3.3` Field/Weather**: high battle-impact gap-fill

Decision pending. Baseline `4a833a4` / 393 tests is safe to pause on.

## v0.5.2 LLM Advice Panel Success Verification

Completed: 2026-05-08

- Verified `scripts/spike_advisor.py` with a valid Gemini API key.
- LLM recommendation returned successfully for the Mega Kangaskhan vs Garchomp spike.
- Recommendation selected `Return`, identified no OHKO, and flagged Garchomp `Outrage` as the main threat.
- Token usage: 1960 input / 148 output / 0 cached.
- Estimated cost: `$0.000958`.
- UI success path confirmed by screenshot:
  - `LLMAdvicePanel` displays the recommendation.
  - Status bar shows `Done | input 1960 / output 148 | $0.0009580`.
  - Fallback cost label also shows the token/cost summary.
- Existing validation remains: `613 passed, 2 deselected`.

Status: v0.5.2 success path verified. Ready for the next UI integration slice.

---

## v0.8.1 — Manual move payload verification attempt

Completed: 2026-05-14

Purpose:
- Attempt to verify the v0.8 manual move selection path from UI-selected Pokemon state to the LLM payload and Gemini response.
- Record the verified payload behavior separately from the blocked Gemini success path.
- Preserve the existing pytest baseline.

Partial verification succeeded:
- Manual move selection path exercised with Charizard vs Garchomp and slot 1 set to Flamethrower.
- Confirmed the selected move button text updates to `화염방사`.
- Confirmed `moves.my_available_moves` includes only the user-selected Flamethrower move.
- Confirmed empty move slots are omitted from `moves.my_available_moves`.
- Confirmed `moves.my_selected_move` matches `moves.my_selected_move_index == 0`.
- Confirmed `moves.move_data_status` is `user_selected_partial_v0.8`.
- Confirmed cache learnsets are not included in the LLM payload.
- Confirmed `moves.opponent_available_moves` remains empty in v0.8.
- Confirmed the UI running state sets the request button disabled, recommendation text to `분석 중...`, and status bar to `Analyzing...`.
- Confirmed the UI recovers after a failed Gemini call by re-enabling the request button and showing the fallback error label.

Blocked / not verified:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` was present in the Codex environment; `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was not present.
- The Gemini endpoint returned HTTP 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` in this environment.
- Gemini success response was not verified.
- LLM response quality was not evaluated.
- The success status bar path `Done | input N / output N | $...` was not verified in this run.
- No API key value was printed, saved, or committed.

Tests:
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 613 passed, 2 deselected.

Remaining limitations:
- A valid T1 local Gemini run is still needed to verify the v0.8.1 success response path.
- Opponent moves are not connected yet.
- Damage/OHKO/2HKO/KO chance are not connected yet.
- EV/IV/nature/item/final stats are not connected yet.
- LLM response quality for the v0.8 selected-move payload remains unjudged because the Gemini call did not succeed.

## v0.9.2b - MoveSearchBox Champions Fixture Integration

Purpose:
- Route move search candidates through the sample Champions movepool fixtures instead of PokeAPI historical Pokemon learnsets.
- Keep PokeAPI move data as metadata only.

Implemented:
- MoveSearchBox now receives candidate move ids from `ChampionsMovePoolRepository`.
- Fixture-backed Pokemon use their sample Champions move ids.
- Pokemon without a Champions movepool fixture show an unavailable search state instead of silently falling back to PokeAPI learnsets.
- Added regression tests for Charizard, Froslass, Vanilluxe, Starmie, missing fixtures, and metadata lookup.

Out of scope maintained:
- No full Serebii/RotomLabs scraping.
- No full roster Champions movepool cache.
- No damage engine changes.
- No four-move comparison.

---

## v0.9.2c - Serebii Champions Full Movepool Cache

Purpose:
- Replace narrow sample movepools with Serebii-derived Champions movepool fixtures for the full local Champions roster.
- Keep PokeAPI pokemon learnsets out of move legality decisions.

Implemented:
- Added `scripts/build_serebii_champions_movepools.py` to parse Serebii Champions Pokédex Standard Moves tables.
- Added `scripts/verify_champions_movepools.py`.
- Generated movepool fixtures for all 276 unique local Champions battle entities.
- Preserved global denial of `tera-blast` and verified `hidden-power` is absent.
- Marked `pawmot` as `unavailable_source_error` because Serebii Champions currently returns 404 for its page.

Verification:
- `uv run python scripts/verify_champions_movepools.py`
- Result: 276 entities, 17,115 listed move entries, unavailable source fixtures: `pawmot`.

Out of scope maintained:
- No RotomLabs scraping.
- No automatic scheduled scraping.
- No damage engine changes.
- No four-move damage comparison.

---

## v0.9.2d - Champions Move Korean Name Coverage

Purpose:
- Ensure every move in the Serebii-derived Champions movepool cache has a Korean display/search name.
- Keep move selection working even when PokeAPI move metadata is not locally cached.

Implemented:
- Added `scripts/update_champions_move_ko_mapping.py`.
- Updated `data/ko_mapping.json` for all 490 Champions move ids.
- Added manual Korean-name overrides for recent moves that PokeAPI does not localize yet.
- Added Champions movepool metadata fallback in `MoveRepository`.
- Verified `expanding-force` maps to `와이드포스` and can be searched for Starmie.

Verification:
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 648 passed, 2 deselected.

---

## v0.8.3 — Advisor Payload Contract

Purpose:
- Freeze the current UI-to-LLM payload contract before selected-move damage estimates are added.
- Keep the Gemini recommendation layer from treating incomplete UI metadata as confirmed battle math.

Added:
- `docs/advisor_payload_contract.md`
- `llm/advisor_payload_contract.py`
- `tests/test_advisor_payload_contract.py`

Contract summary:
- Current payload mode remains `ui-selected-pokemon-v0.8`.
- Payload includes selected Pokemon identity, type, base stats, abilities, HP percent, selected move index, and user-confirmed move metadata.
- Payload explicitly does not include final stats, EV/IV/nature, held items, weather, terrain, boosts, exact HP, opponent moves, damage rolls, OHKO/2HKO/KO chance, turn order, or Turn Engine state.
- Guardrails prohibit the LLM from inferring exact damage, KO odds, speed order, survival, unprovided stats/items/field state, or Terastallization.

Next milestones:
- `v0.9 — Selected Move Damage Estimate`
- `v0.10 — Four-Move Damage Comparison`

---

## v0.9 — Selected Move Damage Estimate

Purpose:
- Add a default-assumption damage estimate for the currently selected user-confirmed move.
- Keep the estimate scoped to `moves.my_selected_move.damage_estimate`.
- Preserve the v0.8.3 guardrails so the LLM does not treat the estimate as final battle damage.

Implemented:
- `llm/advisor_damage_estimate.py`
- Default assumptions: level 50, IV 31 all, EV 0 all, neutral nature, no item, no boosts, no weather, no terrain, no screens, no crit, no ability effects, non-spread single-target estimate.
- `MainWindow._build_llm_battle_input()` now attaches the selected move estimate through the helper instead of doing damage math in UI code.
- `docs/advisor_payload_contract.md` and `llm/advisor_payload_contract.py` now describe the v0.9 estimate and limitations.

Out of scope maintained:
- No OHKO/2HKO/KO chance.
- No four-move comparison.
- No opponent moves.
- No EV/IV/nature/item/final stat UI.
- No Turn Engine.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

---

## v0.10 - Four-Move Damage Comparison

Purpose:
- Add default-assumption damage estimates for each user-confirmed move slot.
- Let the LLM compare the Q/W/E/R moves already selected in the UI without adding KO odds or full battle state.

Implemented:
- `moves.my_available_moves[*].damage_estimate` now uses the same default-assumption schema as the selected move.
- `moves.my_selected_move.damage_estimate` remains available for backward-compatible selected-move advice.
- Status moves and incomplete move payloads return unavailable schemas instead of inferred damage.
- Payload mode updated to `ui-selected-pokemon-v0.10`.

Out of scope maintained:
- No OHKO/2HKO/KO chance.
- No opponent moves.
- No EV/IV/nature/item/final stat UI.
- No weather/terrain/boost/screen UI.
- No Turn Engine.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

---

## v0.10.1 - Four-Move Damage Comparison verification

Purpose:
- Verify the v0.10 four-move damage payload path before moving to the next feature milestone.

Verified:
- Repository started clean and synced with `my_pochamps/master`.
- Offscreen payload check confirmed `moves.my_available_moves[*].damage_estimate` is attached for four user-confirmed move slots.
- Selected move consistency confirmed: `moves.my_selected_move.damage_estimate.selected_move_id` matched the selected slot's move id.
- Damaging moves returned default-assumption `damage_range`, `percent_range`, and 16 rolls.
- Status move handling confirmed with `will-o-wisp` returning `unavailable_status_move`.
- KO chance, OHKO chance, and 2HKO chance fields were absent from available-move estimates.
- Offscreen UI launch succeeded with `Master Ball Advisor v0.10`.
- LLM advice button state transition was verified: enabled -> disabled while running -> enabled after completion state.

Gemini:
- Actual Gemini call was verified with `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash`.
- Gemini returned a recommendation successfully for Charizard vs Gardevoir with four user-confirmed moves.
- The response selected `Overheat` and compared it using the provided damage estimate: 49.0-58.7% of Gardevoir's default max HP.
- The response preserved the main limitation: estimates use default assumptions and are not final battle damage.
- The response did not claim OHKO, 2HKO, KO chance, survival, Tera, EVs, items, or final stats.
- No API key or secret value was printed or committed.
- The UI success path displayed usage (`input 4031 / output 52`) and re-enabled after completion.
- Cost display showed `$0.0000000`, indicating pricing metadata for `gemini-2.5-flash` still needs a TokenLogger update.

Verification:
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 650 passed, 2 deselected.

Remaining limitations:
- Damage estimates remain default-assumption references, not final battle damage.
- EV/IV/nature/item/final stats, field state, exact HP, opponent moves, OHKO/2HKO/KO chance, and Turn Engine remain unconnected.

---

## v0.10.2 - Gemini Cost Logging Semantics

Purpose:
- Clarify what the UI cost number means after `gemini-2.5-flash` showed `$0.0000000`.
- Distinguish Free Tier zero-cost estimates from unknown model pricing.

Implemented:
- Added explicit pricing statuses to `TokenLogger`:
  - `free_tier_zero_cost`
  - `paid_tier_estimated_cost`
  - `unknown_model_or_unknown_pricing`
- Treated `gemini-2.5-flash` as a Free Tier zero-cost estimate in the local logger.
- Preserved paid-tier estimated cost behavior for existing priced models.
- Preserved warnings for unknown model pricing.
- Added `pricing_status` and `pricing_status_counts` to JSONL records and session summaries.
- Updated the UI cost label to show:
  - `Free tier | input N / output N | $0.0000000`
  - `Paid estimate | input N / output N | $...`
  - `Pricing unknown | input N / output N`

Notes:
- The official Gemini API pricing page distinguishes Free Tier from Paid Tier pricing.
- This logger reports local estimated cost semantics only; actual billing depends on the user's Google account, project, tier, limits, and current Gemini pricing.
- Prices and Free Tier availability can change and should be reviewed against the official Gemini API pricing page before budget-sensitive use.

Verification:
- `uv run pytest tests/test_token_logger.py tests/test_advisor_payload_contract.py -q`
- Result: 20 passed.

---

## v0.11 - Opponent Move Payload

Purpose:
- Add opponent move context to the LLM payload without treating possible moves as confirmed.
- Keep v0.10 my-side four-move damage comparison intact.

Implemented:
- Added top-level `opponent_moves` to the advisor payload.
- Added `known_moves` from user-confirmed opponent Q/W/E/R slots.
- Added `candidate_moves` from the Serebii-derived Champions movepool cache.
- Capped `candidate_moves` at 24 entries.
- Added `confidence: "possible_not_confirmed"` to all candidate moves.
- Removed known move ids from candidate moves to avoid duplicate semantics.
- Kept legacy `moves.opponent_available_moves` as an empty compatibility field.
- Updated payload contract guardrails so Gemini must not treat candidate moves as confirmed.

Out of scope maintained:
- No opponent damage estimate.
- No OHKO/2HKO/KO chance.
- No speed or turn order.
- No Turn Engine.
- No EV/IV/nature/item/final stats UI.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

Verification:
- Manual payload check confirmed Garchomp `Earthquake` appears in `opponent_moves.known_moves`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.candidate_moves` is capped at 24 and labeled `possible_not_confirmed`.
- Confirmed known move ids are removed from candidate moves.
- Confirmed `moves.opponent_available_moves` remains `[]`.
- Confirmed opponent moves do not include `damage_estimate`.
- Confirmed v0.10 my-side `damage_estimate` still appears.
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 657 passed, 2 deselected.

---

## v0.11.1 - Opponent move payload Gemini verification

Purpose:
- Verify that the v0.11 opponent move payload separates known opponent moves from possible candidate moves.
- Attempt a Gemini quality check for known/candidate move semantics.

Payload verification:
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves` includes user-confirmed Garchomp `Earthquake`.
- Confirmed known moves use `source: "user_confirmed"`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.candidate_moves` is generated from the Champions movepool cache.
- Confirmed every candidate move uses `confidence: "possible_not_confirmed"`.
- Confirmed candidate moves are capped at 24.
- Confirmed known move ids are removed from candidate moves.
- Confirmed `moves.opponent_available_moves` remains the legacy empty list.
- Confirmed opponent moves do not include `damage_estimate`.
- Confirmed my-side four-move `damage_estimate` remains present.

Gemini:
- Actual Gemini call was attempted with `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash`.
- The Codex tool environment returned `API_KEY_INVALID`, so Gemini response quality could not be verified in this run.
- No API key or secret value was printed or committed.

T1 local app verification:
- Gemini call succeeded from the local PySide app.
- Status bar showed Free Tier cost semantics: `Free tier | input 6473 / output 75 | $0.0000000`.
- In a Charizard vs Garchomp scenario, Gemini recommended `Earthquake` based on the four-move damage comparison.
- The response mentioned the default-assumption limitation.
- The response did not claim KO, OHKO, or 2HKO.
- The response did not assert EVs, IVs, nature, items, boosts, speed order, or final stats.
- No candidate-move overclaim was observed.
- Opponent known/candidate move usage was not strongly visible in the response and needs more observation.

Verification:
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 657 passed, 2 deselected.

Remaining limitations:
- More local Gemini runs are needed to judge whether the model consistently uses `known_moves` as confirmed and `candidate_moves` as possible only.
- Opponent damage estimate remains out of scope until v0.12.

## v0.11.2 - Opponent Move Awareness Prompt/Guardrail Polish

Purpose:
- Make Gemini's interpretation of `opponent_moves` more explicit without changing the payload schema.
- Encourage use of known opponent moves and cautious discussion of candidate moves.

Implemented:
- Added a concise prompt guardrail that:
  - treats `opponent_moves.known_moves` as user-confirmed opponent moves
  - treats `opponent_moves.candidate_moves` as possible, not confirmed, moves
  - allows candidate moves to be mentioned as possible threats only when labeled unconfirmed
  - states opponent move damage is not calculated
  - tells the model to use `my_available_moves` damage estimates for comparing the user's own move options
- Strengthened `ADVISOR_KNOWN_LIMITATIONS` with the same opponent-move semantics.
- Updated the advisor payload contract docs.

Manual verification checklist for T1:
- Confirm a known opponent move is reflected in the response when relevant.
- Confirm candidate moves are not described as confirmed moves.
- Confirm candidate moves, if mentioned, are labeled as possible/unconfirmed threats.
- Confirm opponent damage is not described as calculated.
- Confirm my four-move damage comparison remains part of the recommendation.

Out of scope maintained:
- No payload schema change.
- No opponent damage estimate.
- No candidate sorting polish.
- No UI changes.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

## v0.12 - Opponent Known Move Damage Estimate

Purpose:
- Add default-assumption damage estimates for user-confirmed opponent known moves.
- Let the advisor reason about how threatening a confirmed opponent move is against `my_active`.

Implemented:
- Generalized the LLM damage estimate helper so the attacker and defender payload keys can be selected.
- Added an opponent known move wrapper that calculates `opponent_moves.known_moves[*].damage_estimate`.
- Set opponent known move damage `scope` to `opponent_known_move_only`.
- Set opponent known move damage `target` to `my_active`.
- Kept the same default assumptions as v0.9/v0.10:
  - level 50
  - IV 31 all
  - EV 0 all
  - neutral nature
  - no item, boosts, weather, terrain, screens, critical hit, doubles, or unselected ability effects
- Updated advisor payload contract guardrails for v0.12.

Maintained boundaries:
- Candidate moves do not receive `damage_estimate`.
- OHKO/2HKO/KO chance is not included.
- Speed order, Turn Engine, final stats, EV/IV/nature/item UI, switch recommendation, and lead recommendation remain out of scope.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

Verification:
- Confirmed opponent known move estimates are attached under `opponent_moves.known_moves[*].damage_estimate`.
- Confirmed opponent known move estimates use `target: "my_active"`.
- Confirmed candidate moves do not receive `damage_estimate`.
- Confirmed status known moves return `unavailable_status_move`.
- Confirmed v0.10 my-side damage estimate regression remains covered.
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 661 passed, 2 deselected.

## v0.12.1 - Opponent known move damage Gemini verification

Purpose:
- Verify the v0.12 opponent known move damage payload shape.
- Attempt a Gemini quality check for opponent known move damage awareness.

Payload verification:
- Offscreen payload check used Charizard vs Garchomp with opponent known move `Earthquake`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves[0].move_id` is `earthquake`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves[0].source` is `user_confirmed`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves[0].damage_estimate.status` is `available_with_default_assumptions`.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves[0].damage_estimate.target` is `my_active`.
- Confirmed `is_final_battle_damage` is `false`.
- Confirmed Charizard's Ground immunity is represented as `damage_range: 0-0` and `percent_range: 0.0-0.0`.
- Confirmed candidate moves do not include `damage_estimate`.
- Confirmed `moves.my_available_moves[*].damage_estimate` remains present for four user-confirmed moves.
- Confirmed `moves.opponent_available_moves` remains the legacy empty list.
- Confirmed KO/OHKO/2HKO fields are not present.

Gemini:
- Actual Gemini call was attempted with `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- The Codex execution environment returned `API_KEY_INVALID`, even though the environment variable was present.
- This is recorded as an environment/key validation issue, not a v0.12 payload regression.

T1 local app verification:
- Gemini call succeeded from the local valid-key PySide app.
- Status bar showed Free Tier cost semantics: `Free tier | input 7478 / output 101 | $0.0000000`.
- In a Charizard vs Garchomp scenario, Gemini recommended `Heat Wave` from the user's four move options.
- The response used the four-move damage comparison and cited `Heat Wave` at 18.0-21.3% estimated damage to Garchomp.
- The response recognized the opponent known move `Earthquake`.
- The response interpreted Charizard's Flying typing correctly and stated that Earthquake is ineffective/immune against Charizard.
- Candidate Dragon-type moves were described only as unconfirmed possible threats.
- No candidate move overclaim was observed.
- No opponent damage overclaim was observed.
- The response did not claim KO, OHKO, or 2HKO.
- The response preserved the default-assumption limitation and did not assert EVs, IVs, nature, items, final stats, speed order, or turn outcome.

Verification:
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 661 passed, 2 deselected.

Remaining limitations:
- Codex tool environment Gemini response quality remains unverified because that environment returned `API_KEY_INVALID`.
- The damage estimate remains a default-assumption reference, not final battle damage.
- Candidate move damage, KO odds, speed order, final stats, EV/IV/nature/item, and Turn Engine state remain out of scope.

## v0.13 - Stats Assumption Profile

Purpose:
- Make the stat model behind every damage estimate explicit.
- Clarify that current damage estimates are still default-assumption rough references.

Implemented:
- Added `ADVISOR_DEFAULT_ASSUMPTION_PROFILE` with id `default_level50_ivs31_evs0_neutral_no_item`.
- Added `assumption_profile` to available damage estimates.
- Added `assumption_profile` to unavailable damage estimate schemas.
- Kept the existing `assumptions` field for compatibility.
- Updated advisor payload mode and contract guardrails for v0.13.
- Updated advisor payload contract documentation.

Maintained boundaries:
- No UI changes.
- No final stats input.
- No EV/IV/nature/item input.
- No top-level `stat_profiles`.
- No item selection.
- No KO/OHKO/2HKO, speed order, or Turn Engine.
- No `advisor/damage/` or `advisor/probability/` engine changes.

Verification:
- Confirmed `moves.my_available_moves[*].damage_estimate.assumption_profile` is present.
- Confirmed `moves.my_selected_move.damage_estimate.assumption_profile` is present.
- Confirmed `opponent_moves.known_moves[*].damage_estimate.assumption_profile` is present.
- Confirmed the default profile id is `default_level50_ivs31_evs0_neutral_no_item`.
- Confirmed `source: "system_default"`, `confidence: "rough_reference"`, and `is_user_confirmed: false`.
- Confirmed the existing `assumptions` field remains present.
- Confirmed `is_final_battle_damage` remains `false`.
- `uv run pytest -q`
- Result: 662 passed, 2 deselected.
